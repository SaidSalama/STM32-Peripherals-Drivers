# STM32-Peripherals-Drivers
It is the MCAL drivers for some important peripherals of the STM32microcontroller
## How it is done ?
Each peripheral driver consists of a header file with the preprocessing data and the functions declarations
and a c file that includes the defintions of the functions to use the peripheral
these files are developped according to the Datasheet of the AVR microcontrollers
